  * Accounting Information Systems 3e covers the four roles for accountants with respect to information technology: users of technology and information systems, managers of users of technology, designers of information systems, and evaluators of information systems. Accountants must understand the organization and how organizational processes generate information important to management. The focus of Accounting Information Systems 3e is on the accountant's role as a business analyst in solving business problems by database modeling, database design, and business process modeling. Unlike other texts that provide a broad survey of AIS related topics, this text concentrates on developing practical business analysis skills through real-world examples, problems, and projects. Whether you are developing a new course for AIS or incorporating AIS materials into your existing curriculum, Accounting Information Systems 3e will help your students develop the technological skills they need for their future careers.
